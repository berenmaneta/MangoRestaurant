Web site based on web api using microservices and azure service bus

Hello!

With this project i wanted to learn how to work with some technologies that i don't have the opportunity to work with.
Since in Brazil most companies work with old systems, i do not have the chance to work with stuff like azure, or .NET Core, or containers, the way i want to.
So, i bought a course and started learning by my own.

I this project i built a web site for a restaurant.

I used microservices in order to communicate with the front end and azure service bus to store the messages, in case of the checkout service fails for some time.

I hope you can find it useful.
